      "content": "The plethora of talent that Indian cricket has often made it difficult for players to retain a sustained place in the national team. While Rinku Singh became the victim of competition at the T20 World Cup 2024, Ruturaj Gaikwad didn't get a spot in the team for the tour of Sri Lanka. Neither of the two batters has done anything wrong to sit in the situation they have been in. Still, it's team combination and preference of different kinds of players that forced the selectors to snub them for different assignments. But, not everyone is understandably happy seeing such selection snubs, with former India and Chennai Super Kings batter S Badrinath making some scathing comments in this regard.<br>Badrinath himself took to social media as he shared the video of him launching an attack at the selection committee. He admitted being shocked that Gaikwad didn't make the team for the Sri Lanka series.<br>From the comments made in the video, it was quite understood that the former India star wasn't happy seeing his former franchise's current captain being overlooked despite delivering brilliant performances.",
